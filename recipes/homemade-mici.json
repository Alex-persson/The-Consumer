        "500g lean beef mince",
        "500g lean pork mince",
        "180ml beef stock",
        "50ml beer",
        "1 tsp bicarbonate of soda",
        "1 tsp salt",
        "3 garlic cloves, minced",
        "1 tsp dry thyme",
        "1 pinch nutmeg",
        "1/2 tsp ground coriander",
        "1/2 tsp ground cumin",
        "1/2 tsp black pepper",
        "1/2 tsp cayenne pepper/chilli flakes"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Place the meat into a bowl, you can give it another whizz into the food processor for a double grinding but don’t worry if you don’t fancy doing this. There is another solution - extra mixing/kneading.",
        "In a larger mug, I mix the beef stock with beer, soda bicarbonate, spices, salt pepper and give it a good stir until the salt has dissolved entirely.",
        "Add this liquid mixture to the meat and mix really well until the mixture becomes almost a paste. And this is your double grinding technique",
        "You can now work with a dash of oil or water to form the sausages into their shapes (16 pieces). A little touch of oil takes you a long way so just grease your palms with a tiny dash of oil or, use a bit of water. I always use oil. It helps with preventing them from sticking. Place all on a plate or a little tray, something that can easily be placed in the fridge.",
        "Transfer the open sausages to the fridge to rest for 2 to 4 hours but you can leave them overnight too, it’s absolutely okay.",
        "Place them onto a hot, hot grill or in a hot pan and cook them on each side ( x 2) for no longer than 4 min.",
        "Mici must be served with mustard and a super cold glass of beer."
