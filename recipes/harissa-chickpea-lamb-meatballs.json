        "1kg lamb mince",
        "6 red onions",
        "100g fresh parsley",
        "2 roasted red peppers",
        "1 tbsp ras el hanout",
        "480g (2 cans) drained cooked chickpeas",
        "2 tbsp harissa",
        "1 red chilli (or increase amount of harissa)",
        "1 lemon",
        "2 tbsp pine nuts, optional",
        "3 tbsp raisins, optional"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Preheat the oven to 180Â°C fan.",
        "Tip the lamb mince into a bowl.",
        "Finely chop a third of the red onions and add to the lamb mince with the pine nuts and raisins. Finely chop half of the parsley along with the red peppers and tip them into the bowl, too. Add the ras el hanout and season well with salt and pepper. Mix vigorously until the mixture starts to get a little sticky.",
        "Grab a very large roasting tray and dump in the drained chickpeas. Split the chilli in half and chuck it into the tray, too. Cut the remaining onions into a super chunky dice and get those into the tray with the harissa. Toss everything together with a healthy pinch of salt.",
        "Using wet hands, form the lamb mixture into quite large meatballs (approx. 16) and lay over the chickpeas. Slide into the oven for 45-50 mins, turning the meatballs halfway.",
        "Once cooked, finish with the rest of the parsley and the zest and juice of the lemon."
