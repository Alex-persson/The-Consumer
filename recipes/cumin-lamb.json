        "500g lamb, preferably shoulder, diced, 1/2 x 2 inches (can sub minced lamb to save $$$ and use marinade as stir-fry sauce)",
        "1 heaped tsp ground cunmin",
        "1.5 tsp cornstarch",
        "1 tsp baking soda",
        "0.5-1 tbsp toasted sesame oil",
        "1 tbsp light soy sauce",
        "1 tbsp Shaoxing rice wine",
        "1.5 tbsp cumin seeds",
        "1.5 tbsp high smoke point oil (preferably avocado)",
        "1 tsp red pepper flakes",
        "Pinch of brown sugar",
        "Large handful Thai basil/coriander"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Pad lamb dry with paper towel before cutting. Once cut, combine the lamb with ground cumin, light soy, sesame oil, cornstarch, baking soda, and rice wine in a bowl. Set aside and let marinate for at least 2 hours and up to 24.",
        "Once the lamb has been marinated, heat a wok over medium heat. Add the cumin seeds to the wok and dry toast them until fragrant. Turn off the heat, remove the cumin from the wok, and set aside.",
        "Now heat the wok over the highest setting until it starts to smoke. Add two tablespoons of oil to coat the wok, and then immediately add the lamb. Sear the meat until it turns brown and starts to crisp slightly. The high heat will sear the meat, but keep it tender as well.",
        "Now add the cooked cumin seeds, red pepper flakes, sugar, scallions, basil/coriander, and salt to taste. Toss everything together quickly (so that the scallion and cilantro are just wilted), and transfer to a serving dish. Serve hot with plenty of white rice!"
