        "Cook noodles according to package instructions. Cook frozen edamame and prepare other veggies however you like and keep separate.",
        "Stir together sliced spring onions, grated ginger, olive oil, soy sauce, sherry vinegar, and salt to make the sauce. Make sure to leave for at least 15 mins before using for flavour to develop.",
