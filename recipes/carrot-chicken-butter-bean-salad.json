        "Heat the oven to 200°C. Put the chicken breasts onto a baking tray, then drizzle over a glug of olive oil, the chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Slice half of the lemons and lay the slices on top of the chicken. Transfer to the oven and cook for 15-20 mins until cooked through. Set aside to rest for 10 mins, then slice.",
