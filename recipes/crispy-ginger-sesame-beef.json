        "600g beef (any cut really)",

        "300g tenderstem broccoli",
        "6 spring onions",
        "50g (4-5 inch) ginger",
        "3 garlic cloves",
        "2 tbsp sesame oil",
        "1 tbsp chilli oil",

    "method": [
        "Cut your beef into strips.",
        "Add your cornflour into a bowl and dip in the beef strips. Make sure each strip is evenly coated.",
        "Add a very big glug of vegetable oil to a wok. Once the oil is hot, throw in your beef. Fry the beef in batches so they have space to fry. Remove when nice, brown and crispy (about 3-4 minutes). Set the beef aside.",
        "Pour away the leftover oil and clean your wok. Heat a small splash of vegetable oil in the wok and add your broccoli. Fry on a high heat so that it starts to char.",
        "Finely chop your spring onions and slice your ginger and garlic. Once the broccoli is charred and al dente stir through the chopped spring onions and ginger. Fry for a minute then add in the garlic.",
        "Add in the sesame oil and chilli oil and toss together. Then add in the honey, rice vinegar and soy sauce.",
        "Time to reintroduce your beef. Chuck the beef strips into the pan and add 30ml of water. On a medium heat, keep tossing until your sauce comes together, thickens and turns nice and sticky.",
        "Serve the rice into 4 bowls. Spoon over your gingery beef strips and scatter over the sesame seeds. Dig in!"
