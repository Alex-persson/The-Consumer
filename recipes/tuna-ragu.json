        "Trim and finely dice the shallots, then thinly slice the garlic.",

        "Squeeze the lemon juice in and cook it out completely before tipping the canned tomatoes in. Using the back of a spoon or masher, crush the tomatoes. Bring the mixture to the boil, drop half the basil in (stalks and all), then turn the heat down to a gentle simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 20-25 mins until thickened.",
        "Once thickened, drain the tuna and stir it through the sauce. Taste and season with salt and pepper. Discard the cooked basil and stir through the remaining basil leaves."
