        "500g lean pork mince",
        "30g (2-inch) fresh ginger",
        "4 garlic cloves",
        "6 spring onions",
        "2 tbsp sesame seeds",

    ],
    "method": [
        "Peel the ginger, then cut into slices, then matchsticks, then finely chop. Finely chop the garlic. Cut three-quarters of the spring onions into 4cm pieces, then very finely slice the remaining spring onions and set aside for later.",
        "Drizzle a large frying pan or wok with a little vegetable oil and set over a high heat. Add the pork mince to the pan and break up a little with a wooden spoon. Leave to fry for 2 mins, then flip and break up again. Scatter in the sesame seeds and 4cm pieces of spring onion and continue frying the mince for another 2 mins until starting to get nice and crisp. Add in the ginger and garlic and cook for 2 mins until smelling amazing.",
        "Turn the heat to low and spoon in the miso, soy sauce and water (gradually). Mix really well and cook for 1 min until the mince is glossy and coated in the sauce.",
        "Serve with rice and something like white cabbage."
