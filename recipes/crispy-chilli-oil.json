        "4 shallots",
        "1 bulb garlic",
        "750ml vegetable oil",
        "100g chilli flakes",
        "2 tbsp soy sauce",
        "1 tsp black pepper",
        "2 tsp szechuan peppercorns",
        "1 star anise",
        "1 tbsp MSG",
        "1 tbsp caster sugar"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Thinly slice your shallots and garlic.",
        "Pour your vegetable oil into a large pan. Add your shallots, then bring to a gentle simmer. Cook for 15 mins until the shallots are crisping up and just beginning to turn golden. Add your garlic, then simmer for another 5 minutes until your garlic has gone crispy. Don't let anything burn, you want the garlic and the shallots to only just be golden.",
        "Remove them from the pan of oil and leave to drain and crisp up on a plate lined with kitchen paper for 10 minutes.",
        "Meanwhile, add your chilli flakes, soy sauce, both types of peppercorns and star anise, MSG and sugar to a large bowl. Pour your oil through a sieve into the chilli bowl and give it a good stir.",
        "Add your crispy garlic and shallots back into the oil mixture. Leave to infuse for a day before eating.",
        "Ladle your oil into sterilised jars and use within 1 month."
