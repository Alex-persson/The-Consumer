    "ingredients": [
        "6 tbsp (or more) Thai green curry paste (good quality not oily jar stuff - trust me!)",
        "1 can (400g) coconut milk, full fat (good quality or it will be watery)",
        "500g boneless skinless chicken thighs",
        "1 small aubergine, sliced 1cm thick on the diagonal",
        "1-2 tbsp fish sauce",
        "Small pack Thai basil",
        "100g mange tout (no string beans!)",
        "3-4 lime leaves, torn in half",
        "2 tbsp palm sugar (sub 2 tsp light brown sugar)",
        "200-250ml chicken stock (bone broth best)",
        "Juice of 1/2 lime (or to taste)",
        "2 cups cooked jasmine rice, to serve",
        "2 large garlic cloves, minced (for store-bought curry paste)",
        "1.5-inch fresh ginger, grated (for store-bought curry paste)",
        "1 tbsp lemongrass paste (for store-bought curry paste)",
        "1 green/red bell pepper, sliced, optional",
        "2 green chillies, sliced, to garnish",
        "Crispy fried Asian shallots, to garnish"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Heat a large wok over high heat with a splash of vegetable oil. Cut chicken thighs into quarters (1-2 inch pieces). Add chicken to wok and brown all over (5 mins), then set aside.",
        "Add curry paste to the wok (and garlic, ginger & lemongrass extras if using). Cook for 2-3 minutes until it starts to 'dry out' and become fragrant. Add coconut milk and dissolve the paste, then add stock bit by bit until you get to your desired thickness.",
        "Add palm sugar and fish sauce to taste (carefully). Add lime leaves and bring to a simmer.",
        "Return the chicken to the wok, stir and lower heat so it's gently bubbling. Cook for 7 minutes. Add aubergine and cook for a further 5 minutes.",
        "Add mange tout and green/red pepper if using. Cook for a further 2 minutes then stir through basil and lime juice. DO NOT keep simmering, the sauce will not reduce further and simply get unpleasantly darker.",
        "Serve over rice with your choice of garnishes."
