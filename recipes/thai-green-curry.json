        "2 medium onions",
        "500g thinly sliced beef (or steak - freeze for 1 hour and slice)",
        "2 tsp sugar",
        "2 tbsp mirin",
        "2 tbsp soy sauce",
        "1 cup/235ml dashi (can sub beef stock)",
        "2 spring onions, sliced",
        "720g cooked white rice, to serve (3 cups)",
        "1-2 tbsp sake, optional",
        "4 eggs, optional",
        "2 tsp toasted sesame seeds, to garnish",
        "Shichimi togarashi, to garnish"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Heat neutral oil in a large skillet over medium high heat, and cook the sliced onions for about 5 minutes, stirring often.",
        "Add the beef and sugar, and cook until the beef is slightly browned. Add the mirin, soy sauce, stock (and sake). Bring to a simmer, and cook for about 10-15 minutes to reduce the stock into a thin sauce. Taste for seasoning, and add a little more soy sauce if needed.",
        "Meanwhile, heat another couple tablespoons of oil in a cast iron or non-stick skillet. Cook the eggs sunny-side up. You can cook them in batches if needed. The yolks should still be runny! <strong>Alternatively</strong>, poach the eggs for something lighter.",
        "When the beef is done simmering, divide the rice among serving bowls (the original recipe is for 4, so 4 bowls), and top with the beef and an egg for each bowl. Garnish with chopped scallion and toasted sesame seeds, if using."
