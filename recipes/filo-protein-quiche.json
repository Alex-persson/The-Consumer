    "ingredients": [
        "7 large eggs",
        "300g cottage cheese (low fat but not fat free)",
        "50ml semi-skimmed milk",
        "150g spinach, wilted and chopped (from frozen works)",
        "1 pack (100g) chives (can sub dill/tarragon)",
        "100g smoked salmon, roughly sliced (or use another protein)",
        "Zest of 1 lemon",
        "4 sheets of filo pastry (~125g) (or sub tortillas)"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Preheat oven to 160Â°C fan. Combine milk and cottage cheese in a blender and blitz until smooth. Transfer to a large bowl and add eggs. Whisk to combine.",
        "Mix in remaining ingredients and stir until evenly distributed. Season well with salt and pepper.",
        "Layer a pastry sheet over a 20cm deep cake tin. Overlap sheets to make sure all gaps are covered and form a sturdy crust. I do this by placing 4 sheets off centre in each direction, heavily overlapping the top edge of the tin.",
        "Pour egg mixture into the prepared filo crust, tuck edges back down to meet the mixture with a tight fold. If you want you can add cheese on top at this point.",
        "Bake in the oven for an hour. Allow to cool for 15 mins before slicing. Enjoy hot or cold!"
