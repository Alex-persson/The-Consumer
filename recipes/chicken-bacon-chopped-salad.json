        "3 large chicken breasts",
        "180g smoked streaky bacon",
        "200g tenderstem broccoli",
        "2 sweet gem lettuces",
        "200g cooked quinoa (80g / 0.5 cup uncooked)",
        "1 tsp wholegrain mustard",
        "1.5 lemons (1 is fine)",
        "4 tbsp olive oil",
        "2 tbsp honey"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Boil the broccoli in a pot of salted boiling water for 3-4 mins until it’s just about cooked. Then remove it and allow it to cool.",
        "Preheat your oven to 180°C. Season your chicken breasts generously with salt and pepper. Place your breasts onto a baking tray and get them in the oven for 25 mins. Allow them to cool once cooked – the salad doesn’t need to be warm. Add the bacon in for the last 10 mins until crispy.",
        "Heat up your quinoa according to the package instructions.",
        "Add lettuce, broccoli, chicken, and bacon to a board and chop it all up.",
        "Add it all to a bowl with the quinoa.",
        "Make the dressing with oil, lemon juice, mustard, and honey. Mix it all up until emulsified and coat the salad.",
        "Give it a good toss and serve on plates."
