        "1 whole cucumber",
        "1/2 tsp salt",
        "4-5 spring onions, finely sliced",
        "1-2 inch raw ginger, grated (sub. 1 tsp ground ginger)",
        "1 garlic cloves, minced",
        "3 tbsp rice vinegar",
        "1 tbsp soy sauce",
        "1 tsp toasted sesame oil (sub olive for health)",
        "1 tsp honey",
        "1 tsp sriracha",
        "1-2 tbsp toasted sesame seeds",
        "4-5 mini peppers, optional"

    "method": [
        "Slice the cucumber (and mini peppers if using) thinly. Place in a bowl and toss with salt to help them release water. Let this stand whilst you prepare other ingredients",

        "Season to taste, adding more sriracha if you like.",
        "This will keep up to 3 days in the fridge but it will start to pickle a bit (not a bad thing!)"
