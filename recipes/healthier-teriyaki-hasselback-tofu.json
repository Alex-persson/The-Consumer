    "ingredients": [
        "1 block (approx. 300g) extra firm tofu",
        "1 tsp cornstarch",
        "1.5 tbsp low sodium soy sauce",
        "1 tbsp honey",
        "1 garlic cloves, minced",
        "1 tsp ginger, freshly grated <strong>or</strong> 0.5 tsp ground ginger",
        "1 tsp toasted sesame oil",
        "toasted sesame seeds, to garnish",
        "1 spring onion, sliced, to garnish"
    ],
    "method": [
        "Place block of tofu between two layers of kitchen roll. Weight down with a heavy pan/object to press the tofu for at least 30 mins. Preheat oven to 200Â°C fan.",
        "Meanwhile mix together the cornstarch, soy sauce, honey, sesame oil, garlic and ginger to make your sauce.",
        "Once the tofu has been pressed it's time to prepare it. Place two chopsticks either side of your tofu and cut 3-4mm grooves into the block, using the chopsticks to stop you cutting through. If you want to make slightly smaller portions slice the block into two thinner steaks first. <strong>Note:</strong> you may need to increase the quantity of sauce to glaze two steaks properly.",
        "Use half the sauce to coat the hasselback tofu steak, making sure to brush it into the slots. Reserve the other half. Then put into the oven for 30 mins.",
        "Halfway through cooking brush the steak with more of the sauce.",
        "After cooking brush the steak again with the remaining sauce. Serve with rice and garnish with sesame seeds and spring onion."
